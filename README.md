# Chess
Chess app made w/ vanilla JS, HTML, CSS (WIP)

`script.js` contains all of the code associated with rendering the chess game onto the webpage. 
`chess.js` contains game logic.
`setup.js` simply sets up the board at the beginning of every game.

At the moment, I haven't implemented checkmate and certain mechanics of checks. For example, during checks any piece can still move wherever it wants, and
pinned pieces can still move. Only the King's movement is affected by the possibility of checks.
