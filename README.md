# Chess
Chess app made w/ vanilla JS, HTML, CSS

`script.js` contains all of the code associated with rendering the chess game onto the webpage. 
`chess.js` contains game logic.
`setup.js` simply sets up the board at the beginning of every game.

Pawns only promote to queen. Might add other pieces later, idk.
